# H1Emu-CSharp-Server

Server doesn't work... yet, also the server runs on dotnet 6.0.

Translating the typescript of original H1emu server to c#.

Documentation will be provided later on when I get to a certain point and the server works to a certain point i.e. getting to the main menu of H1Z1 Just Survive.

Big Thanks to Kentin/QuentinGruber for starting up H1Emu, Meme for helping me out big time when working on the server, Eavilaswayce for helping with the C# code, GhostsKappa for
being a giant help with me, working on the server for H1Z1 KotK, LegenedsNeveerrDie for helping with great suggestions, ideas, and providing SoE/Daybreak Documentation on
H1Z1 as a whole, to be as close to a functioning server as possible!, without all of you and many more people/contributors, this wouldn't be possible at all, so thank you!
